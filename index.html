        <h2>FOOD</h2>
<p>Budapest is famous for its excellent food, as traditional Hungarian cuisine is among the best and richest in Europe. Traditional Hungarian restaurants offer tasty food, often accompanied by traditional Gipsy musicians, who come to your table to play Hungarian tunes directly into your ear.

It is a common misconception that Hungarian food is all goulash (Guly√°s) and spicy paprika meals, just as not everything that's Italian is pasta, and not everything that is Indian is spicy.

Hungarian food has an unmistakable character, often rich with sour cream, onions, eggs, butter, fresh produce and wine. Vegetarian cuisine, however, is not the strength of Hungarian cooking, but there are a couple of characteristic vegetarian meals, such as fried cheese and fried mushrooms which are widely popular.

These days every type of cuisine is available in Budapest, so there is a great selection of Italian, French, Chinese and even Mongolian restaurants in the city.</p>
